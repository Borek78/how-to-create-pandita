### ADDITIONAL BENEFITS

</div>
The CC licences are not usefull only for creating audiobooks. There are other benefits of using them.<br><br>

<div class="underline"> Permanent permission </div>
While the authors and translators are still alive, they can give permission to use their work. After their passing away, they will not be able to give these permission.<br><br>

If the authors and translators apply the CC licenses on their work, it will be possible to use their work also when they are not around. That is another important benefit of using the CC licenses.<br><br>

<div class="underline">Better sharing</div>
There are a few books available on my dharmazdarma.cz website.<br><br>

However, other buddhist groups do not reupload the books on their websites. One of the reasons might be that they assume that they are not allowed to do so. They do not have the copyright. As a result, the online presence of these books is entirely dependent on me.<br> <br>

Adding a last page with a CC notice could encourage others to reupload, translate and reuse the books.

### MY INSPIRATION
</div>

I am very inspired by Ajahn Sujato´s beautiful article Copy this! It is long article about Buddhism and copyright. The following three parts can be found in the article and, in my opinion, they summarize the article very well.<br><br>

The article discuses primarily Buddhist scriptures but similar conclusion could be made when discussing Buddhist books.<br><br>

</div>

<div class="citace">
 ”Buddhism is about letting go, copyright is about holding on.” 
</div>

<div class="citace">
But regardless of whether it has certain applications in some areas, it contradicts fundamental Buddhist principles and should never be applied to Buddhist scriptures. 
</div>

<div class="citace">
When I first made some translations, I offered them under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-alike license, which is fairly permissive but requires attribution. After some time, I felt this was bad because Buddhist texts are traditionally regarded as buddhavacana (and should not be owned by any one person). I was also concerned that the license was just setting up barriers where none were necessary. After switching to CC-Zero, I haven’t had any second thoughts.
</div>

Ajahn Sujato translated the four Nikāyas from Pali into English and used CC-zero license to place his translation in the public domain. <br> <br>

After reading Ajahn Sujato´s article I decided to use — whenever possible — the most liberal license. Unfortuantely, the CC-Zero can not be used in the Czech Republic. The czech copyright law does not allow to waive all copyright. Therefore, the czech CC license experts recommend using CC BY license instead.<br>

### SUMMARY

As a Buddhist content creator, I can make a very good use of books that are licensed under one of these three licenses: CC-Zero, CC BY and CC BY-SA. All the other licenses are too restrictive for my purposes.<br> <br>

The CC licenses are not just a legal tool. They are also a communication tool and an encouragment for those who would like to translate Buddhist books or create audiobooks of them. The presence of CC notices in books can also encourage others to share books on their websites.<br> <br>

I am still very new to using CC licenses for Dhamma sharing purposes. I welcome any feedback, comments or advice. <br> <br>

If you used CC licenses for Dhamma sharing purposes, I would definitely like hear about it. Please feel free to write me an email about your success stories.<br> <br>
