### ADDITIONAL BENEFITS

</div>

The CC licenses are not useful only for creating audiobooks. There are other benefits of using them.<br><br>

<div class="underline"> Permanent permission </div>
While authors and translators are still alive, they can allow the use of their work. They will not be able to grant this permit after their death.<br><br>

If the authors and translators apply the CC licenses to their work, it will be possible to use their work also when they are not around. That is another important benefit of using the CC licenses.<br><br>

Sometimes a Buddhist organization inherits the copyright. But that is not always the case.<br><br>

<div class="underline">Better sharing</div>
There are a few books available on my [dharmazdarma.cz](http://www.dharmazdarma.cz/) website.<br><br>

However, other Buddhist groups do not reupload the books on their websites. Perhaps they assume that they are not allowed to do so. They do not have the copyright. As a result, the online presence of these books is entirely dependent on me.<br> <br>

Adding the last page with a CC notice could encourage others to reupload, translate and reuse the books. This is a suggested text of the last page.

### MY INSPIRATION
</div>

I am very inspired by Ajahn Sujato´s beautiful article Copy this! It is a long article about Buddhism and copyright. The following three parts can be found in the article and, in my opinion, they summarize the article very well.<br><br>

The article discusses primarily Buddhist scriptures but a similar conclusion could be made when discussing Buddhist books.<br><br>

</div>

<div class="citace">
 ”Buddhism is about letting go, copyright is about holding on.” 
</div>

<div class="citace">
But regardless of whether it has certain applications in some areas, it contradicts fundamental Buddhist principles and should never be applied to Buddhist scriptures. 
</div>

<div class="citace">
When I first made some translations, I offered them under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-alike license, which is fairly permissive but requires attribution. After some time, I felt this was bad because Buddhist texts are traditionally regarded as buddhavacana (and should not be owned by any one person). I was also concerned that the license was just setting up barriers where none were necessary. After switching to CC-Zero, I haven’t had any second thoughts.
</div>

After reading Ajahn Sujato´s article I decided to use — whenever possible — the most liberal license. Unfortunately, the CC-Zero can not be used in the Czech Republic. The Czech copyright law does not allow to waive all copyright. Therefore, the Czech CC license experts recommend using the CC BY license instead.<br>

### SUMMARY
</div>

As a Buddhist content creator, I can make very good use of books that are licensed under one of these three licenses: CC-Zero, CC BY, and CC BY-SA. All the other licenses are too restrictive for my activities.<br> <br>

The CC licenses are not just a legal tool. They are also a communication tool and an encouragement for those who would like to translate Buddhist books or create audiobooks of them. The presence of CC notices in books can also encourage others to share books on their websites.<br> <br>

I am still very new to using CC licenses for sharing the Dhamma. I welcome any feedback, comments, or advice. <br>
