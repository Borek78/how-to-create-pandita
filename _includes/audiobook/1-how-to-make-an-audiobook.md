# AUDIOBOOKS, CC LICENSES AND SHARING THE DHAMMA

From 2005 to 2015 I was publishing Dhamma books in the Czech language for free distribution. Dharma zdarma (Free Dharma) was the name of the project. The website of the project is still available on

It was quite easy to organize. There were just a few steps involved.<br><br>
<span>1.</span> Asking the author for his permission.<br>
<span>2.</span> Asking the translator for his/her permission.<br>
<span>3.</span> Fundraising.<br><br>

Last year I started to think about creating some audiobooks too. To my surprise, I realized that creating Dhamma audiobooks is much more complicated.<br><br>

Why?<br><br>

The first reason is rather obvious. Audiobook production includes one additional step — recording the voice of the narrator. But there is another obstacle to making audiobooks — copyright. <br><br>

<p id="go-to-content">And how can I obtain the copyright to make an audiobook?</p>

### ASKING FOR PERMISSION
</div>

The first option is to contact the authors and the translators and ask them for their permission to create an audiobook of their work and share the audiobook publicly on my YouTube channel.<br><br>

But there are two issues with this option.<br><br>

<div class="underline">Number of users</div>
What happens if I die and YouTube decides to terminate my YouTube channel? Is there anyone else who is allowed to upload the book online? No. If I am the only person with permission, nobody else is allowed to upload the book online. As a result, the audiobook may not be accessible to the general public anymore.<br><br>

<div class="underline">Community support</div>
In order to publish an audiobook, I will have to find a narrator. This could be a volunteer or a professional actor. I may also need to do some fundraising. In other words, I will certainly need the support of our local Buddhist community.<br><br>

However, the members of our local community may hesitate to support me. They may have this question in their mind:

<div class="citace" markdown="1">
„This is a nice book. It would be good to make an audiobook of it. But Dalibor is the only person with permission to share the audiobook publicly. One day Dalibor is going to die and YouTube may terminate his YouTube channel. As a result, the book may not be accessible to the general public anymore. Isn't there a better way to organize this?“
</div>

The good news is that there is a better to organize the publishing of Buddhist audiobooks. The CC licenses are a good tool that could be used for this purpose.
