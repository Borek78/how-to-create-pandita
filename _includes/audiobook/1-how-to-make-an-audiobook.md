# HOW TO MAKE A BUDDHIST AUDIOBOOK

From 2005 to 2015 I was publishing Dhamma books in czech language for free distribution. Dharma zdarma (Free Dharma) was the name of the project. The website of the project is still available on www.dharmazdarma.cz. <br><br>

It was quite easy to organize. There were just a few steps involved.<br><br>
<span>1.</span>Asking the author for his permission.<br>
<span>2.</span>Asking the translator for his/her permission.<br>
<span>3.</span>Fundraising.<br><br>

Last year I started to think about creating some audiobooks too. To my surprise, I realized that creating Dhamma audiobooks is much more complicated.<br><br>

Why?<br><br>

The first reason is rather obvious. Audiobook production includes one additional step – creating audio track from the czech translation. Many members of our buddhist community are good translator but none of us is a trained narrator. But some of us might be able to learning new a new skill. Another option is to hire a professional narrator.

But there is another obstacle to creating audiobooks - copyright. This article is about copyright and creating audiobooks for free distribution.<br><br>

A few books have been translated to Czech language. How can I obtain a permission to create audiobooks from these translations?<br><br>

### ASKING FOR PERMISSION

The first option is to contact the authors and the translators and ask them for their permission to create an audiobook of their work. I also need their permission to upload the audiobook online on my YouTube channel.<br><br>

There are two issues with this option.<br><br><br>

<div class="underline">Number of users</div>
But what happens if I die and YouTube decides to terminate my YouTube channel? Is there anyone else who can upload the book online? No, if I am the only person with the permission to use it, nobody else is allowed upload the book online . As a result, the audiobook may not be accessible to general public anymore.<br><br><br>

<div class="underline">Community support</div>
In order to publish an audiobook, I will have to find a narrator. This could be a volunteer or a professional actor. I may also need to do some fundraising. In other words, I will certainly need support of our local Buddhist community.<br><br>

However, the members of our local comunity may hesitate to support the audiobook production. They may have this question in their minds:

<div class="citace" markdown="1">
„This is a really nice book. It would be great if an audiobook adaptation would be available in our language. But Dalibor is the only person that has the permission to use the audiobook on YouTube. One day Dalibor is going to die and YouTube may terminate his YouTube channel. As a result, the book may not be accessible to the general public anymore. Is there not a better way to organize this?“
