### CC LICENSES AND AUDIOBOOKS
</div>

Marking a creative work with a CC license is usually done with a license notice that includes the name of the author, the name of the license, a link to the license, and a link to the original work. There are a few marking examples on these two websites.<br><br>

The examples on the two pages above mention only one or two authors. But audiobook production is more complicated. It requires work and permission of three creators: <br><br>

<span>1.</span> the writer.<br>
<span>2.</span> the translator.<br>
<span>3.</span> the narrator.<br><br>

So what kind of CC marking should I use for Dhamma audiobooks in the Czech language? Unfortunately, I have not found a good example to follow. Let me create an imaginary example.<br><br>

<div id="example" markdown="1">
<div class="underline">Imaginary example</div>
</div>

Let me assume that there is a Buddhist author Good Writer and he wrote a book The Life of the Buddha. He published his book under the CC-Zero license and the book is available online on the author´s website www.good-author-website.com. The following CC notice can be found in the book. <br>

<div class="citace">
The Life of the Buddha was written by Good Writer and it is licensed under the CC-Zero license:<br>
<div class="do-not-break-out" markdown="1">

</div>
The book is available on www.good-writer-website.com.
</div>

A few years later a Czech volunteer Good Translator finds the book online and he decides to translate it. The title of the Czech translation is Buddhův život.<br><br>

Good Translator wants to publish his translation under the CC BY license. How can he do that? What kind of CC notice should he use?<br><br>

He certainly should not forget about the CC notice that is associated with the original work. A good practice is to copy and paste the original notice. <br><br>

<b> Lastly, is there anything else I should know before I use it? </b><br><br>

When you accessed the material originally did it come with any copyright notices; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; or a notice of previous modifications? (That was a mouthful!) Because that kind of legal mumbo jumbo is actually pretty important to potential users of the material. <span class="highlighted-text-green"> So best practice is to just retain all of that stuff by copying and pasting such notices into your attribution.</span> Don't make it more complicated than it is -- just pass on any info you think is important.

</div>

The original book is licensed under the CC-Zero license and, as a result, the translator does not have to mention the name of the author and the link to the original work. But it is a good practice to do it.<br><br>

This could be the translator´s CC notice.

<div class="citace" markdown="1">

After some time, another volunteer decides to turn Buddhův život into an Audiobook. The name of the volunteer is Good Narrator. <br><br>

Good Narrator narrates the book and the name of the audiobook is also Buddhův život. What kind of CC notice should be used for the audiobook? This is a possible solution.

<div class="citace" markdown="1">
