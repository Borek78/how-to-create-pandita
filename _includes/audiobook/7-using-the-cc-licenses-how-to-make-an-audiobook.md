### USING THE CC LICENSES
</div>

Marking a creative work with a CC licence is usually done with a license notice that includes the name of the author, the name of the license and link to the license. There are a few marking examples on these two websites.<br><br>

<br>
But most of the examples mention only one author. Creating an audiobook in czech language will require permission of three authors.<br><br>

<span>1.</span> Permission of the author.<br>
<span>2.</span> Permission of the translator.<br>
<span>3.</span> Permission of the narrator.<br><br>

So what kind of marking should I use in this situation? Unfortunately, I have not found a good example to follow. So let me create one. I have made up the names.<br><br>

<div id="example" markdown="1">
<div class="underline">Example</div>
</div>

Let me assume that there is a buddhist author Good Writer who wrote a book The Life of the Buddha. He published his book under the CC BY licence and the book is available online on the author´s website www.good-author-website.com. The following CC notice can be found in the book. <br>

<div class="citace">
The Life of the Buddha was written by Good Writer and it is licensed under the CC BY license:<br>
<div class="do-not-break-out" markdown="1">

</div>
The book available on www.good-writer-website.com.

</div>

A few years later a czech citizen Good Translator finds the book online and he decides to translate it. The title of the czech translation is Buddhův život.<br><br>

Good Translator also wants his translation to be availalable under the CC BY license. How can he do that? What kind of CC notice should he include in his book?<br><br>

He certainly should not forget about the notice that is associated with the original work. A good practice is to copy and paste the original notice. <br><br>

[ the text bellow can be found on the website above, you just need scroll down ]<br>

<div class="citace" markdown="1">
<b> Lastly, is there anything else I should know before I use it? </b><br><br>

When you accessed the material originally did it come with any copyright notices; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; or a notice of previous modifications? (That was a mouthful!) Because that kind of legal mumbo jumbo is actually pretty important to potential users of the material. So best practice is to just retain all of that stuff by copying and pasting such notices into your attribution. Don't make it anymore complicated than it is -- just pass on any info you think is important.

</div>

That means that the translator´s notice could look like this.

<div class="citace" markdown="1">
The title of this book is Buddhův život. It is a Czech translation of a book  that was originally written in English. The title of the English original is The Life of the Buddha.<br><br>

A few years later another volunteer decides to turn Buddhův život into an Audiobook. The name of the volunteer is Good Narrator. <br><br>

Good Narrator narrates the book and the name of the audiobook is also Buddhův život. What kind of notice should he associate with his audiobook? This is a possible solution.

<div class="citace" markdown="1">
The title of this audiobook is Buddhův život. It is was created of a book that was originally written in English and later it was translated into the Czech language. The title of the English original is The Life of the Buddha and the title of the Czech translation is also Buddhův život.<br><br>
