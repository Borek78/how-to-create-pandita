### SA CONDITION
</div>

These two license have the Share-alike (SA) condition. <br><br>

[CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
[CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)<br><br>

<div class="underline"> Share alike explanation </div>
If a book is published under a CC BY-SA license, the translator also has publish his translation under the CC BY-SA license. And not only that, the audiobook creator who uses the translation also has to to publish his work under the CC BY-SA.<br><br>

And the same applies to the CC BY-SA-NC license.<br><br>

If a book is published under a CC BY-SA-NC license, the translator also has publish his translation under the CC BY-SA-NC license. And not only that, the audiobook creator who uses the translation also has to to publish his work under the CC BY-SA-NC license.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA and commercial use</div>
The NC condition is not part of this license and so, theretically, this license can be used by an author who wants to use his book.<br><br>

However, many publishing companies may be discouraged by the license.<br><br>

Let me assume that there is a publishing company that translated a buddhist book, printed a few thousand copies and started to sell it. Other publishing companies may notice that the book is published under CC BY-SA license and if the book is a bestseller they might be willing to make use of it. They can also have the book printed and sell it. As a result, the first company may not earn as much money as it could. They may not even have enough profit to pay back the translation.<br><br>

And what about an audiobook? Is it possible to make money on audiobooks that are published under the CC BY-SA license? Propably not. The first buyer can share the book with anyone he wants. He can upload it on YouTube. He can even start selling audiobook.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA AND YOUTUBE</div>
One day YouTube might display add on all YouTube channels. In my opinion, it is not very likely but it could happen. In that case, all YouTube channel owners would have to delete all content published under one of the NC licencses.<br><br>

Could anything like this happen to content published under the CC BY-SA license? Perhaps YouTube could ad this statement in the Terms of Services.<br><br>

“It is not allowed to upload content licensed under the CC BY-SA license.”<br><br>

I do not think that it is very likely. The more content on YouTube the better for YouTube. YouTube is a commercial project and they financialy benefit from all the content that is available on the platform. Advertisment is always just a few click away.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA CONCLUSION</div>
Translation of CC BY-SA licensed book for commercial purposes does not seem to me very likely. But it seems to me that a buddhist volunteer like myself could make a good use of CC BY-SA licensed books. <br><br>
