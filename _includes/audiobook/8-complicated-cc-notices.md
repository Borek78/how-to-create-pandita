The CC notices above may seem complicated. But if it is required by the situation, complicated CC notices can be used. Different situations require more or less complicated notices and there is no singular way to give a notice.<br><br>

„CC licenses are designed to let others know how they may use a work without infringing copyright. Sometimes, it may be helpful for a licensor to offer users guidance beyond the terms of the license. CC licensors can use notices and marking to inform users of any limitations on the application of the CC license to their work. Typically, creators give either a notice visually next to the relevant content, or at the beginning or end of a work, as appropriate for the medium, or both. <span class="highlighted-text-blue">There is no singular, correct way to give a notice, and different situations may require more or less complicated notices and marking.</span> CC offers additional explanation and tips on giving thorough notices and marking for works. “

<div class="underline"> Only the copyright</div>
</div>

An important feature of the CC licenses is that they only apply to the copyrights that an author has in the entire work. The following sentence can be found in the imaginary example. <br><br>

“...his translation is licensed under CC BY license:”<br><br>

The sentence says that only the translation is licensed under CC BY. It does not say that „the translated text is licensed under CC BY license“. <br><br>

The translated text includes the work of both the writer and the translator. Therefore, the translator can not apply the license to the text of the translated book. He can only apply the license to his work – his translation.<br><br>

<b>„May I apply a CC license to my work if it incorporates material used under fair use or another exception or limitation to copyright?<br><br></b>

Yes, but it is important to prominently mark any third party material you incorporate into your work so reusers do not think the CC license applies to that material. <span class="highlighted-text-green">The CC license only applies to the rights you have in the work. </span>For example, if your CC-licensed slide deck includes a Flickr image you are using pursuant to fair use, make sure to identify that image as not being subject to the CC license.

<span class="highlighted-text-green">  When a creator or rightsholder applies a Creative Commons license to a work, the license automatically applies to any copyrights the licensor has in the entire work. </span>Ideally, licensors will have all the rights necessary to license a work, since they otherwise potentially expose users to liability. Alternatively, licensors that do not have all the necessary rights can inform users with notice statements and/or marking that explains the limitations on the license, warning, for instance, that a particular element of a work is not freely available or that additional rights clearance may be necessary. Some licensors may also wish to exempt certain portions of a work from the application of the CC license. For instance, a creator may wish to apply a CC license to one chapter of a book. Creative Commons licenses are flexible in their application, and licensors may use them as they find appropriate. To avoid confusion or misunderstanding on the part of users, however, it is important to mark a work clearly to identify portions not subject to the CC license.

In the imaginary example, three authors have their copyright in the audiobook: the author, the translator, and the narrator. Each one of them applied a different CC license to his work: CC-Zero, CC BY, and CC BY-SA. In other words, three different CC licenses were applied to three different parts of a creative work.<br><br>

Is it possible? Is it possible to combine CC licenses in this way?<br><br>

Yes, CC licenses can be combined. But not all licenses are compatible. There is more information about this on the Creative Commons FAQ page. <br><br>

People like creating audiobooks for other people. For free. The LibriVox project is a wonderful example of this. It also shows the potential of the CC licenses for sharing the Dhamma. <br><br>

<div class="do-not-break-out" markdown="1">

</div><br>

All the audiobooks on the LibriVox website are in the public domain. In other words, all the books and the audio recordings (narrations) are in the public domain. Dhammapada is one of the books that is available on the LibriVox website.<br><br>

There are a few Dhammapada versions on the LibriVox page. One of them is also available on YouTube.<br><br>

The marking on LibriVox website is in the title of the website. There is also a CC-Zero symbol at the bottom of the website and a short audio note in the Dhammapada recording.<br><br>

There is another way to publish an audiobook under a CC license. The following is an interesting situation. <br><br>

Good Author, Good Translator, and Good Narrator have their copyright in the audiobook. Let me assume that all of them decided to apply the CC-BY ND license to the copyright they have in the audiobook. As result, the audiobook is published under the CC-BY ND license.<br><br>

Let me also assume that Good Author has not applied a CC license to his original work, his book. He only applied a CC license to the copyright he has in the audiobook.<br><br>

The important part here is that the CC-BY ND license does not allow to create derivatives: write down the text of the audiobook and distribute it, translate the audiobook and distribute it and so forth. As a result, Good Author is in total control over his original work. He has retained all his copyright to the original work.<br><br>
