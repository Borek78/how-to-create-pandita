### CC0 AND CC BY

A book published under the CC-Zero is dedicated to the public domain. It is a free work anyone can use in any way. The author did let go of his copyright. <br><br>

The CC BY license is just a bit different. Simply speaking, anyone can use the CC BY licensed work in any way. Only the name of author has to be mentioned and the link to the original resource needs to be provided. <br><br>

These two licenses should be used if the author wants his work to be used as freely as possible. Any book published under one of these two licenses can be translated and used for audiobook production without any restraint (CC0) or significant restraint (CC BY).<br><br>

### MY INSPIRATION

I am very inspired by Ajahn Sujato´s article Copy this! It is long article about Buddhism and copyright. This following parts can be found in the article and, in my opinion, they summarize the article very well. <br><br>

<div class="citace">
 ”Buddhism is about letting go, copyright is about holding on.” 
</div>

<div class="citace">
But regardless of whether it has certain applications in some areas, it contradicts fundamental Buddhist principles and should never be applied to Buddhist scriptures. 
</div>

<div class="citace">
When I first made some translations, I offered them under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-alike license, which is fairly permissive but requires attribution. After some time, I felt this was bad because Buddhist texts are traditionally regarded as buddhavacana (and should not be owned by any one person). I was also concerned that the license was just setting up barriers where none were necessary. After switching to CC-Zero, I haven’t had any second thoughts.

Ajahn Sujato translated the four Nikāyas from Pali into English and used CC-zero license to place his translation in the public domain. <br> <br>
