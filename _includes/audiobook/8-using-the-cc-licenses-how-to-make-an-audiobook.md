„CC licenses are designed to let others know how they may use a work without infringing copyright. Sometimes, it may be helpful for a licensor to offer users guidance beyond the terms of the license. CC licensors can use notices and marking to inform users of any limitations on the application of the CC license to their work. Typically, creators give either a notice visually next to the relevant content, or at the beginning or end of a work, as appropriate for the medium, or both. <span class="highlighted-text-blue">There is no singular, correct way to give a notice, and different situations may require more or less complicated notices and marking.</span> CC offers additional explanation and tips on giving thorough notices and marking for works. “

<span class="highlighted-text-blue">There is no one, right way to give notice, and different situations may require more or less complicated notices and marking.</span> The following tips may be helpful, however, in designing a clear and informative notice.<br><br>

<div class="underline"> Only the copyright</div>
</div>

An important part of the CC licenses is that they allow to license only the copyright that an author has in the entire work. An example of this can be found in the example. The following sentence can be found in the notices:<br><br>

“...his translation is licensed under CC BY license:”<br><br>

The sentence claims that only the translation is licensed under CC BY. It does not claim that „the traslated text is licensed under CC BY license“. <br><br>

The translated text includes work of both the writer and the translator. Therefore, the translator can not apply the license on the text of the traslated book. He can apply the license only on his work – his translation.<br><br>

„May I apply a CC license to my work if it incorporates material used under fair use or another exception or limitation to copyright?<br><br>

Yes, but it is important to prominently mark any third party material you incorporate into your work so reusers do not think the CC license applies to that material. <span class="highlighted-text-green">The CC license only applies to the rights you have in the work. </span>For example, if your CC-licensed slide deck includes a Flickr image you are using pursuant to fair use, make sure to identify that image as not being subject to the CC license. For more information about incorporating work owned by others, see our page about marking third party content. Read more considerations for licensors here.“

<span class="highlighted-text-green">  When a creator or rightsholder applies a Creative Commons license to a work, the license automatically applies to any copyrights the licensor has in the entire work. </span>Ideally, licensors will have all the rights necessary to license a work, since they otherwise potentially expose users to liability. Alternatively, licensors that do not have all the necessary rights can inform users with notice statements and/or marking that explains the limitations on the license, warning, for instance, that a particular element of a work is not freely available or that additional rights clearance may be necessary. Some licensors may also wish to exempt certain portions of a work from the application of the CC license. For instance, a creator may wish to apply a CC license to one chapter of a book. Creative Commons licenses are flexible in their application, and licensors may use them as they find appropriate. To avoid confusion or misunderstanding on the part of users, however, it is important to mark a work clearly to identify portions not subject to the CC license.

In the Imaginary example, three authors have their copyright in the audiobook: the author, the translator and the narrator. Each one of the them applied a different CC license on his work: CC-Zero, CC BY and CC BY-SA. In other words, three different CC licenses were applied to three different parts of a creative work.<br><br>

Is it possible? Is it possible to combine CC licenses in this way?<br><br>

Yes, CC licenses can be combined. But not all licenses are compatible. There is more information about this on the Creative Commons FAQ page. <br><br>
