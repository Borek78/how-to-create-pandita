### NC CONDITION
</div>

Three of the CC licenses have the NC condition included. However, I have already discussed the CC BY-NC-ND license in the previous part and, therefore, only the two following licenses are discussed in this part. <br><br>

<div class="do-not-break-out" markdown="1">

[CC BY NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0)<br>
[CC BY NC SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0)

</div><br>

These two licenses do not include the ND condition and they certainly can be used if the author wishes to grant permission:<br>

- to translate his book and let the translator share his translation publicly<br>

- to create an audiobook and let the creator share the audiobook publicly<br><br>

There are a few obvious consequences of using an NC license. Any book licensed with an NC license:<br>

- can not be used for commercial purposes<br>

- a translation of the book can not be used for commercial purposes<br>

- an audiobook made of the translation can not be used for commercial purposes<br><br>

And what about YouTube? Is it possible to use NC-licensed audiobooks on YouTube? <br><br>

<div class="underline">NC licenses and YouTube </div>
 All CC licenses can be used on YouTube. This information can be found on the Creative Commons Corporation website.

<div class="citace">
„For third-party platforms: Many media platforms like Flickr, YouTube, and SoundCloud have built-in Creative Commons capabilities, letting users mark their material with a CC license through their account settings. The benefit of using this functionality is that it allows other people to find your content when searching those platforms for CC-licensed material. If the platform where you’re uploading your content does not support CC licensing, you can still identify your content as CC-licensed in the text description of your content.“

But YouTube can display ads on any YouTUbe channel. This information can be found in YouTube´s Terms of Service.<br><br>

<div class="citace">
<strong>Right to Monetize</strong><br><br>
You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties. If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.

[the text above was copied from the British version of Terms of Service but the same condition can be found in the Czech version]<br><br>

In the Czech Republic, the Right to Monetize agreement has been added to the Terms of Services on 1.06.2021. Only once I have noticed an ad on my channel [PANDITA CZ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1IIp3Yo_PaJPsEU9BUk1ew). I do no know what it means. Perhaps YouTube is not going to monetize my channel?<br><br>

I have not noticed any ads on many YouTube channels. Usually these channels are owned by non-profit organizations. It seems to me that YouTube does not monetize these channels at the moment. But in the future, YouTube may start to display ads on all channels. As result, it may not be possible to use NC licensed content on YouTube.<br><br>

<div class="underline">My conclusion</div>
As a YouTube channel owner, I would hesitate to upload any NC licensed Buddhist content on my channel. Presently I am not sure if YouTube is displaying ads on my channel. <br><br>

But as a Buddhist content creator, I would rather avoid working with NC licensed content because it may not be possible to use it on YouTube in the future.<br><br>
