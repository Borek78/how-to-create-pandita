### SA CONDITION
</div>

These two licenses have the Share-alike (SA) condition. <br><br>

[CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)<br>
[CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)<br><br>

<div class="underline"> Share alike explanation </div>
If a book is published under the CC BY-SA license, the translator also has to publish his translation under the CC BY-SA license. As a result, the audiobook creator also has to publish his work under the CC BY-SA license.<br><br>

And the same applies to the CC BY-SA-NC license.<br><br>

If a book is published under the CC BY-SA-NC license, the translator also has to publish his translation under the CC BY-SA-NC license. As a result, the audiobook creator also has to publish his work under the CC BY-SA-NC license.<br><br>

In other words, the SA condition pushes other creators to waive their copyright. <br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA and commercial use</div>
The NC condition is not part of this license and, therefore, any book available under the CC BY-SA license can be used for commercial purposes.<br><br>

However, a best-seller licensed under the CC BY-SA license can be printed for sale also by all the competitors and, as a result, it is probably not possible to make a lot of money on a book licensed under the CC BY-SA license.<br><br>

And what about audiobooks? Is it possible to make money on audiobooks that are published under the CC BY-SA license? Probably not. The first buyer can share the book with anyone he wants. He can upload it to YouTube. He can even start selling the audiobook.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA and YouTube</div>
Could YouTube add this statement into the Terms of Services in the future?<br><br>

“Use of the CC BY-SA license is not allowed on YouTube.”<br><br>

I do not think it is very likely. The more content on YouTube the better for YouTube. YouTube is a commercial project and they can financially benefit from all the content available on the platform.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA conclusion</div>
CC BY-SA is not a very good license for commercial purposes.  But a Buddhist content creator and volunteer like me should be able to make good use of CC BY-SA licensed books. <br><br>
