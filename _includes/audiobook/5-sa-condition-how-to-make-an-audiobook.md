### SA CONDITION
</div>

These two licenses have the Share-alike (SA) condition. <br><br>

[CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)<br>
[CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)<br><br>

<div class="underline"> Share alike explanation </div>
If a book is published under a CC BY-SA license, the translator also has publish his translation under the CC BY-SA license. As a result, the audiobook creator also has to publish his work under the CC BY-SA license.<br><br>

And the same applies to the CC BY-SA-NC license.<br><br>

If a book is published under a CC BY-SA-NC license, the translator also has publish his translation under the CC BY-SA-NC license. As a result, the audiobook creator also has to publish his work under the CC BY-SA-NC license.<br><br>

If not for the SA condition, the translator and audiobook creator could retain their copyright. In other words, the SA condition pushes users to waive their copyright.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA and commercial use</div>
The NC condition is not part of this license and, therefore, any book available under CC BY-SA can be used for commercial purposes.<br><br>

However, many commercial publishing companies may be discouraged by this license. This is an example.<br><br>

There is a publishing company that had a boodhist book translated, printed it and started to sell it. Another company noticed the CC BY-SA license and they also decided to print the book for sale. As a result, the profit of the first company is not good enough to pay back the translation.<br><br>

And what about audiobooks? Is it possible to make money on audiobooks that are published under the CC BY-SA license? Propably not. The first buyer can share the book with anyone he wants. He can upload it on YouTube. He can even start selling the audiobook.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA and YouTube</div>
One day YouTube might display ads on all YouTube channels. In my opinion, it is not very likely but it could happen. But if it happens, all YouTube channel owners will have to delete all NC licensed content. <br><br>

Could this happen to a content published under the CC BY-SA license? Perhaps YouTube could add this statement in the Terms of Services.<br><br>

“It is not allowed to upload content licensed under the CC BY-SA license.”<br><br>

I do not think that it is very likely. The more content on YouTube the better for YouTube. YouTube is a commercial project and they financialy benefit from all the content available on the platform.<br><br>

<div class="underline">CC BY-SA CONCLUSION</div>
Translation of CC BY-SA licensed book for commercial purposes does not seem very likely. But a buddhist content creator and volunteer like me should be able to make a good use of CC BY-SA licensed books. <br><br>
