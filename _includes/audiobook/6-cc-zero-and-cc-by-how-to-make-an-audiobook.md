### CC-Zero AND CC BY
</div>

A book published under the [CC-Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) is dedicated to the public domain. It is a free work anyone can use in any way. The author did let go of his copyright. <br><br>

The [CC BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) is just a little different. Simply put, anyone can use CC BY licensed work in any way. Only the author's name must be given and a reference to the source must be provided. <br><br>

These two licenses should be used if the author wants his work to be used as freely as possible. A book that has been published under one of these two licenses can be translated and used to create an audiobook without any restrictions (CC-Zero) or significant restrictions (CC BY).<br><br>

<div class="underline"> Expiration of copyright </div>

Copyright law protects all books only for a limited time. It is usually for the life of the author + 50-70 years. The number of years depends on the country.<br><br>

<br>

In other words, all Dhamma books will enter the public domain one day. When the CC-Zero license is applied, it only speeds up the process of copyright expiration.<br><br>
