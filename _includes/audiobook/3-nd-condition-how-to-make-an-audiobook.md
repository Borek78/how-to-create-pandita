### ND CONDITION
</div>

Two of the CC licenses have the ND condition included. Books published under one of these two licenses can be translated; it is also possible to make an audiobook of them. But these works can be used only privately, it is not allowed to distribute them. This is obvious from the following part. <br><br>

<strong>NoDerivatives</strong> — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.

 <div class="underline">Legal code </div>
The legal code version of these two licenses gives the same reply. It is just a bit more technical.<br><br>

According to the legal code, both translations and audiobooks are adapted material and adapted material can not be shared.<br><br>

Translations are explicitly mentioned. Audiobooks are not. But audiobooks are a material in which the Licensed Material is "modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor."
