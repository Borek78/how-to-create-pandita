Dear Dhammafriends,<br><br>

My names is Dalibor and I am from the Czech Republic. I am creating a buddhist [YouTube channel PANDITA CZ.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1IIp3Yo_PaJPsEU9BUk1ew) The channel is for czech audience. I am inspired by the very succesfull polish [YouTube channel Sasana.pl.](https://www.youtube.com/c/sasanaPL/featured)<br><br>

I created this blog to communicate with my Dhammafriends from abroad. Perhaps it will also help me to share some of my experiences.<br><br>

I am also writing a czech version of this blog. It is still very incomplete. The template is the same but the content is not identical. <br><br>

Best regards,<br><br>

Dalibor Pavlik<br>
