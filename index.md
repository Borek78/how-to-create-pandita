Welcome to my blog.<br><br>

My names is Dalibor. I am from the Czech Republic. Presently I am creating a Buddhist YouTube channel PANDITA CZ. The channel is for Czech audience.<br><br>

I am inspired by the very successfull YouTube channel sasana.pl.<br><br>

I created this blog to communicate with my Dhammafriends from abroad. Perhaps it will also help me to share some of my experiences.<br><br>

Presently there is just one article on the blog.<br><br>

Best regards,<br><br>
