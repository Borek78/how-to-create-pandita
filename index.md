Dear Dhammafriends,<br><br>

My name is Dalibor and I am from the Czech Republic.<br><br>

I am very inspired by the effort of all the volunteers who created the polish [Sasana.pl](http://sasana.pl/) website and the very successful [YouTube Channel Sasana.pl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1IIp3Yo_PaJPsEU9BUk1ew). I am trying to initiate similar project here in the Czech Republic and I started to create [Pandita.cz](https://pandita.cz/) website and [PANDITA CZ YouTube Channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1IIp3Yo_PaJPsEU9BUk1ew).<br><br>

I created this blog to communicate with my Dhammafriends from abroad. Perhaps it will also help me to share some of my experiences.<br><br>

I am also writing a Czech version of this blog. It is still very incomplete. The template is the same but the content is not identical. <br><br>

Best regards,<br><br>

Dalibor Pavlik<br>
